## Module One: Final Project
#### By Briana Baker and Kenny Hom

#### Our app
  We seeded a database with 5,000 movies based on The Movie Database API. The user can search the database by movie title or actor name. They can also see top movies in a genre, and top movies for any actor. Top movies must have at least 500 votes to be considered.

#### Instructions
  This is a Command Line Interface app, so must be used in terminal.
  1. Fork and clone the repository
  2. Bundle install
  3. Type "ruby bin/run.rb" to start.

#### Contributors Guide
  We used a dataset of 5,000 movies from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). Kaggle's data was procured from The Movie Database API (https://themoviedb.org), but was not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
